How to use VirtualTourist_8
======
1. This application works by allowing you do select locations on a map. Once you've select locations on the map, you can view a series of 
images form the particular location. So as soon as you start the application, you should see a map.

2. At this point, you can touch the screen, press and hold for a few seconds and a pin will appear on the screen.

3. Click on the pin and it will reveal a new view that displays images from the location that you selected from the map.

4. At this point you can press the "new collections" button and get a random set of images from the location that you picked. 

5. To return to the map, click on the "back" button. Once you've returned to the map, you can click the edit button and a red button should appear at the bottom of the map.
